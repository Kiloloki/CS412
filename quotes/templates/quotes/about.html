<h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>
<p>
  Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known
  for the theory of relativity and the famous equation E = mcÂ². He also made key
  contributions to quantum mechanics, especially the photoelectric effect, which
  earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. Born in the German Empire,
  Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, later working at the Swiss Patent
  Office. His 1905 "miracle year" produced four groundbreaking papers, including
  those on special relativity and Brownian motion. In 1915, he introduced
  general relativity, transforming our understanding of gravity and the cosmos.
  He emigrated to the U.S. in 1933 due to Nazi persecution and became an
  American citizen in 1940. In later years, Einstein opposed the probabilistic
  nature of quantum mechanics and pursued a unified field theory, though
  unsuccessfully. Despite growing isolated, his legacy profoundly shaped modern
  physics.
